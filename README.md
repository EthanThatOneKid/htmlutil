> A module for facilitating HTML development in Go

## Project status: WIP

I started experimenting with a custom way of composing HTML elements.
This is considered reinventing the wheel, so I do not recommend usage of this software.
To clarify, `htmlutil` is an experimental Go module aiming to facilitate my personal HTML/CSS/JS development.
